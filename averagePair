/*//Task 5 - Average Pair
//Write a function that takes 2 arguments. 1 is a sorted array of numbers, and another which references an 
//average of numbers. With the numbers in the array, check to see whether any pair of numbers in
//the array can equal passed in the other argument. You must use pointers in your answer.


//WorkList
  //Create pointers which will reference the pair of numbers in the array
  //Create logic that will get the average of 2 numbers
  //Create logic that will move 1 pointer through the array, and another which will only move
  //if the tail array has reached the end of the array increment the head array and set tail to head
  //Logic to return false if all combinations have been exhausted
  //Add use cases i.e. if if empty array is passed
