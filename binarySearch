/*

Create a function which accepts an array and returns the index at which the value exists. MUST use binary search logic.


Let min = 1min=1m, i, n, equals, 1 and max = nmax=nm, a, x, equals, n.
Guess the average of maxmaxm, a, x and minminm, i, n, rounded down so that it is an integer.
If you guessed the number, stop. You found it!
If the guess was too low, set minminm, i, n to be one larger than the guess.
If the guess was too high, set maxmaxm, a, x to be one smaller than the guess.
Go back to step two.
